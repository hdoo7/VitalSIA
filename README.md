   ```bash
   choco install git nodejs
   ```

2. Install Yarn using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

3. Fork the repository on GitHub and then clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EVA-libre.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EVA-libre
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### macOS

2. Install Yarn using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

3. Fork the repository on GitHub and then clone your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EVA-libre.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EVA-libre
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Linux

   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Server

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. Deploy the build to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

This will automatically deploy the site to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository, making it available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/EVA-libre`.

## Animation Manager

The Animation Manager is responsible for controlling the visual animations of characters. To use the Animation Manager, import it into your project and create an instance of it.

Example:
```javascript
import AnimationManager from './src/VISOS/action/visualizers/AnimationManager';

const animationManager = new AnimationManager();
// Use animationManager to control animations
```

## Setting up an App

In `app.js`, you can set up the initial environment and include the main components of the system, such as the Animation Manager and the newly added UI sensor components.

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react';
import SmileControl from './src/VISOS/perception/UI/SmileControl';
import AnimationManager from './src/VISOS/action/visualizers/AnimationManager';

function App() {
  const animationManager = new AnimationManager();
  // Setup and use animationManager as needed

  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <div className="App">
        <h1>EVA-libre System</h1>
        <SmileControl />
        {/* Include other UI components as needed */}
      </div>
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Voice Manager and Speech Manager

### Voice Manager
The Voice Manager handles the configuration and management of different voices within the system. It integrates with various text-to-speech (TTS) engines to provide natural and dynamic voice outputs.

### Speech Manager (MS TTS)
The Speech Manager is specifically designed to work with Microsoft Text-to-Speech (TTS) services. It handles the conversion of text to speech using MS TTS, providing an interface for easy integration into applications.

Example setup and usage:
```javascript
import VoiceManager from './src/VISOS/action/verbalizers/VoiceManager';
import SpeechManager from './src/VISOS/action/verbalizers/SpeechManager';

// Initialize Voice and Speech Managers
const voiceManager = new VoiceManager();
const speechManager = new SpeechManager(voiceManager);

// Use speechManager to convert text to speech
speechManager.speak("Hello, this is a test using MS TTS.");
```
